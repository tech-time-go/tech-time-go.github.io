## The AGA (American Go Association) rating system

- k: Kyu ranks are considered student ranks.
- d: Dan ranks are considered master ranks.
- p: Professional dan ranks.

The AGA system uses numerical ratings. Generally, positive AGA ratings represent dan ranks, and negative AGA ratings represent kyu ranks.

So: 5d > 2d > 2k (-2) > 5k (-5)
